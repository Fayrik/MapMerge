# MapMerge Tool

This project is an attempt at recreating the functionality in the archaic java bytecode file "mapmerge.jar" found in most older SS13 repositories.
Its purpose is to sanitize BYOND .dmm files for version control systems such as GIT, and can perform this task automatically when comitting or manually through an interactive mode.
